## **What is it?**
This is an MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architectural pattern library.

## **Who is it for?**
If you want to organize your projects with an architectural pattern and are looking for a library that is relatively simple and easy to learn, then this is for you.

## **What does Model View Presenter do anyway?**
MVP is a pattern to develop user interfaces by separating by 3 responsibilities:
- Model; how data is stored and accessed
- View; how data is shown to and interacted by the user (no logic, just passes requests to the presenter)
- Presenter; how data is collected to be shown in view and how the user interaction will be acted upon

Even though its purpose was developing user interfaces we will see how it fits into our game development projects.
